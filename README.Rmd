## Estimating chloroquine in vivo MIC from VHX dataset

VHX was a longitudinal study of vivax malaria patients along the Thailand-Myanmar border.
We provide the fitted PK estimates of the CQ profiles, the time until relapse, and the parasite biomass at patency of recurrence.

The full data analysis can be found in the *R* file *Fit_VHX_data.R*.
